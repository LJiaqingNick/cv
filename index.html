        <p>
            I'm Jiaqing(Nick) Liu, currently in a Master's Program in Computer Science at Northeastern University.
            I love solving different kinds of real-life problems. Before enrolling in this program, I was a sales support for an Electronic component trading company. 
            My primary role is to search for electronic components on the open market for the OEM and EMS. Unfortunately, the search pool contains millions of different part numbers, 
            and it is a tedious job to look at them one by one. Thus, I self-taught Python and narrowed it down to hundreds. This experience makes me realize the importance of computers. 
            Thus, I decided to transition to a technical field. Use the problem-solving and technical skills (acquired during this program) to solve those real-life problems. 
            This is important for me to seek a co-op job to help the company and apply what I learned. Comfortable with: Python, Java, Javascript, Typescript, C, CSS, HTML, React Framework, and Linux Administration.
